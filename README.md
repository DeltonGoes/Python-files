## Travelling Thief Problem

This Python script provides a solution to the Traveling Thief Problem (TTP) using a genetic algorithm approach. The script reads data from various TTP datasets, performs genetic algorithm operations such as crossover and mutation, and evaluates the fitness of the solutions based on both profit and time.

## Overview

The Traveling Thief Problem is an extension of the classic Traveling Salesman Problem with an added twist of optimizing the profit gained by a thief moving through cities while considering the capacity of a knapsack.
